Instruction on running the end-organ model

The whole model contains four .py files:

1. model_constants.py
2. gen_function.py
3. lif_model.py
4. stress_to_spike.py

1 contains the constants essential to run the whole model.
2 is the code for the generator function.
3 is the code for the LIF model.
4 is the complete model, which calls 1, 2, and 3 when running. 

To run the whole model, open 4: stress_to_spike.py in a python ide (for example, Spyder).
Clike "run" to run a sample stress input.

The input data files used in this model in my thesis are all included in the folder "time and stress data". You may change the input files in 4.
